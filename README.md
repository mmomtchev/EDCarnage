# Installation

Grab a binary from `Releases` - there is a Windows installer and a stand-alone ZIP folder

# Usage

Nothing really to do, just launch it and it will parse the Elite Dangerous journal.

As Elite Dangerous does not allow tracking which mission is currently progressing, per-hour statistics are not always accurate - if you have a high-paying and a low-paying mission, `EDCarnage` will take into account only the average mission reward.

Happy bounty hunting!
